# Manifest for resync application
#
# To my knowledge GitHub does not support hierarchical repositories outside
# of perhaps git submodules.  However, submodules are not so good so I've
# implemented hierarchical repositories using repo names and this manifest.
#
# The dashes in the repo names represent directory separation.  There are
# some repos like svn-to-git/ that have acutally dashes in the repo name.
# Have not escaped these dashes in any way.   Might do this at some point.
