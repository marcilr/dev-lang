Glossary for snmp


MIB - A management information base (MIB) is a database used for managing
      the entities in a communication network.  Most often associated with
      the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the term is also used
      more generically in contexts such as in OSI/ISO Network management
      model.  While intended to refer to the complete collection of
      management information available on an entity, it is often used to
      refer to a particular subset, more correctly referred to as MIB-module.

      Objects in the MIB are defined using a subset of Abstract Syntax
      Notation One (ASN.1) called "Structure of Management Information
      Version 2 (SMIv2)" RFC 2578. The software that performs the parsing
      is a MIB compiler.
