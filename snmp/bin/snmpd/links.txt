Net-SNMP Tutorial -- snmpd
This is a basic tutorial for configuring the Net-SNMP snmpd daemon.  Note the
word basic.  This tutorial covers the use of snmpconf to create a
configuration file (snmpd.conf) for snmpd.  Note that snmpconf only
understands a subset of the tokens that snmpd offers, so it is possible that
some tokens will remain undocumented.  Consult the snmpd.conf man page for
more information on those tokens.
