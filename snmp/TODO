+++ Thu Aug 31 08:17:41 AKDT 2017 - One idea is to right a mib browser for
    linux, under say xfce, that I really like.

    The API to use would be the net-snmp library:
      Net-SNMP is available for many Unix and Unix-like
      operating systems and also for Microsoft Windows.
      http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/

    Granted mbrowse is pretty good:
      A graphical SNMP MIB browser based on GTK+ and Net-SNMP

    The Net-SNMP C API
