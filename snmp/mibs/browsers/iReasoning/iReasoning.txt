iReasoning MIB browser is a powerful and easy-to-use tool powered by
iReasoning SNMP API . MIB browser is an indispensable tool for engineers to
manage SNMP enabled network devices and applications.  It allows users to
load standard, proprietary MIBs, and even some mal-formed MIBs.  It also
allows them to issue SNMP requests to retrieve agent's data, or make changes
to the agent.  A built-in trap receiver can receive and process SNMP traps
according to its rule engine.

Download iReasoning mibbrowser.zip archive.  Expanded and
ran ireasoning/mibbrowser/browser.command in order to properly open mibs.
Running browser.sh does not work.  It will not properly traverse the directory
tree to open specific MIB files.

Once MIB opened not so bad.  Not great either.
