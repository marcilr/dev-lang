Installation of iReasoning MIB browser on GCI Network Services, OSS
Debian wheezy 7.7 amd64 workstation.


1. Download iReasoning MIB browser, mibbrowser.zip, from download page:
http://ireasoning.com/downloadmibbrowserlicense.shtml

2. Unzip mibbrowser.zip:
$ unzip mibbrowser.zip

Observe expanded mib browser:
$ ls ireasoning/mibbrowser/browser.command 
ireasoning/mibbrowser/browser.command

NOTE: Be advised that running browser.sh runs a broken mib browser.  It
      cannot properly traverse directories to open mib files.

3. Install ireasoning/ jar files to accessible directory:
# mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/lib
# cp ireasoning/mibbrowser/lib/browseraux.jar /usr/local/bin/lib
# cp ireasoning/mibbrowser/lib/browser.jar /usr/local/bin/lib
# chown root:staff /usr/local/bin/lib/browseraux.jar

NOTE: Yes this is required.  Updating CLASSPATH alone did not work.

4. Install ireasoning/ mib browser to /usr/local/ireasoning directory:
# chown -R root:staff ireasoning/
# mv ireasoning/ /usr/local/


NOTE: Checking for unset varible is more complicated than you would think:

5. Created "ireasoning" symlink to browser.command executable
for improved execution:
# ln -s /usr/local/ireasoning/mibbrowser/browser.command \
/usr/local/bin/ireasoning

6. Test it:
$ ireasoning &

Runs good.
