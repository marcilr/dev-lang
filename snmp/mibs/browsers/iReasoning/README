iReasoning.txt
  iReasoning MIB browser is a powerful and easy-to-use tool powered by
  iReasoning SNMP API . MIB browser is an indispensable tool for engineers to
  manage SNMP enabled network devices and applications.  It allows users to
  load standard, proprietary MIBs, and even some mal-formed MIBs.  It also
  allows them to issue SNMP requests to retrieve agent's data, or make changes
  to the agent.  A built-in trap receiver can receive and process SNMP traps
  according to its rule engine.
