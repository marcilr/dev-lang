snmpb


SnmpB is an SNMP MIB browser written in QT.  It supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c & 
SNMPv3.  SnmpB can browse/edit/load/add MIB files and can query SNMP agents.
It also supports agent discovery, trap events, and graph plotting.

snmpb recommended
=================
I highly recommend using another MIB browser, such as snmpb.  The
functionality and interface of SnmpB are far superior for obtaining accurate
SNMP values, in my opinion, compared to tkmib.  The MIB browsing, polling, as
well as setting MIBS is far less painful than using tkmib
