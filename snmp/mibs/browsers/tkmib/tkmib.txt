tkmib - SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) MIB browser

Installed on GCI Network Services, covellite workstation November 25, 2014.

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a framework for exchange of
the management information between the agents (servers) and clients.  The
Management Information Bases (MIBs) contain a formal description of a set of
network objects that can be managed using the SNMP for a particular agent.
tkmib is a graphical user interface for browsing the MIBs.  It is also capable
of sending or retrieving the SNMP management information to/from the remote
agents interactively.

tkmib broken
============
The tkmib package appears to have been 'broken' for some time now.

Take a look at the very old bug No values from OIDs with tkmib on the Debian
mailing list from 2010.  The default net-snmp version that shipped with Ubuntu
has been 5.4.3 and does work as expected with other SNMP-dependant
applications (e.g. Cacti) but not with tkmib.

I recently compiled a new version of net-snmp (version 5.7.2) following these
instructions and was able to get some minimal use out of tkmib.

After compilation, I was able to get some values returned by tkmib.  However
the application interface does not act as one might expect.  That is, when
issuing a get query on a MIB instance (say querying the sysDesc MIB, for
example), tkmib returns a value of NOSUCHINSTANCE.  However, while issuing a
getnext query upon the same instance returns the actual expected value.

I highly recommend using another MIB browser, such as snmpb.  The
functionality and interface of SnmpB are far superior for obtaining accurate
SNMP values, in my opinion, compared to tkmib.

The MIB browsing, polling, as well as setting MIBS is far less painful than
using tkmib

If you are set on using tkmib, keep in mind that you will also need to
manually create a ~/.snmp directory to save any of your changed values between
sessions.

If you are interested in taking snmpb for a spin, you can download the .deb
file here, and install it with sudo dpkg -i snmpb_0.8_i386.deb

Best of luck.
