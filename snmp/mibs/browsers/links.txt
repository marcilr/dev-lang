iReasoning MIB browser is a powerful and easy-to-use tool powered by
iReasoning SNMP API . MIB browser is an indispensable tool for engineers to
manage SNMP enabled network devices and applications.  It allows users to
load standard, proprietary MIBs, and even some mal-formed MIBs.  It also
allows them to issue SNMP requests to retrieve agent's data, or make changes
to the agent.  A built-in trap receiver can receive and process SNMP traps
according to its rule engine.
