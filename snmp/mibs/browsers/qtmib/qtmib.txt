qtmib


an SNMP MIB browser for Linux platforms

qtmib is an easy-to-use SNMP MIB Browser based on QT4 library.  It is build
as a front-end for net-snmp, and it allows the user to query any SNMP-enabled
device.  It implements SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, and it is released under GPL v2
license.

NOTE: There does not appear to be a debian package for qtmib.

You can also install your own MIBs by copying them into
~/.config/qtmib/mibs directory.
