Paths


First off, you should know about the paths that the tools load MIBs from.
By default, it loads things from the following list of directories:

  $HOME/.snmp/mibs
  /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs

The former, $HOME/.snmp/mibs, exists on GCI Network Services, OSS 
Debian wheezy 7.8.0 amd64 covellite workstation.
