At the starting of each MIB there will be few lines ending with FROM. For Eg:

IANAifType-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

IMPORTS
MODULE-IDENTITY, mib-2 FROM SNMPv2-SMI
TEXTUAL-CONVENTION FROM SNMPv2-TC;

In this case you need to have SNMPV2-SMI & SNMPv2-TC are the dependency.

Sometimes it happens that you might see just one FROM file and the dependent
file has additional dependency. but the concept remains same.

HTH.
