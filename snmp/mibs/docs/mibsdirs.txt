mibs directories


If you're running a version that doesn't provide the base MIBs as part of
libsnmp-base, I'd suggest manually downloading the MIBs and putting them in
one of these directories:

  $HOME/.snmp/mibs
  /usr/share/mibs/site
  /usr/share/snmp/mibs
  /usr/share/mibs/iana
  /usr/share/mibs/ietf
  /usr/share/mibs/netsnmp

since those directories are (apparently) used as the search path by tkmib (and
other software).
