  Superb book !
  by A Customer on June 15, 1999
  Format: Paperback
  This is simply one of the best books I've come across in any field.
  If you want to write your own mibs, or if you are writing an snmp
  agent, this book is invaluable.  Very lucid, very neat illustrations.
  I highly recommend it.  Yes, you do need some network management
  exposure to get the best out of this book.

  Worth the Money
  By Terrence on January 22, 2000
  Format: Paperback
  I have read and reviewed most of these SNMP books.  In general, they are not
  very good. This one is EXCELLENT.  However, it is definitely for people
  developing mibs and not somebody looking to understand how SNMP works.  It
  is a resource as an SNMP developer I could not live without.

  The Bible of MIB Design
  By O. Gura on January 7, 2009
  Format: Paperback
  Let me start simple: I'm neither a book author nor a professional "reviewer".
  The only reason for this review -- and yes, this is my very first one -- is
  that I'm truly impressed with "SNMP MIB Handbook".  Let me try to explain
  how did I happen to find it -- and why do I consider it
  "The Bible of MIB Design".
  ...
  After reading some introductory tutorials and not-so-introductory books, it
  occurred to me that something is missing, while 80% of information is
  "covered" again and again.  Everybody talks about familiar subject: SNMP
  history, the fact that SNMP is based on UDP -- and how it is encapsulated;
  differences between SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, the internal format of
  different types of SNMP messages, what is MIB, the concept of TRAP
  (notification), how to configure and use various commercial or freeware SNMP
  tools, etc.

  What's missing then? Here is the short answer: nobody tells you how to
  DESIGN *your* MIB.

  Let me make an analogy: there are plenty books on English Grammar; there are
  also quite a few on different reading "techniques".  But how many books will
  teach you writing?  Not writing in general, but writing *good prose* or
  *nice poems*? There you are!
