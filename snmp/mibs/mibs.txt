MIBs - Management Information Base


A management information base (MIB) is a database used for managing the
entities in a communications network.  Most often associated with the Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the term is also used more generically in
contexts such as in OSI/ISO Network management model.  While intended to refer
to the complete collection of management information available on an entity,
it is often used to refer to a particular subset, more correctly referred to
as MIB-module.
