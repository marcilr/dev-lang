List mib directories


First off, you should know about the paths that the tools load MIBs from.
By default, it loads things from the following list of directories:

  $HOME/.snmp/mibs
  /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs

Note that many distributions change the default paths.  To find out which
directories are used on your system, run the following command:
  net-snmp-config --default-mibdirs

(if that doesn't work because your distribution didn't repackage
net-snmp-config you can use this instead:)
  snmptranslate -Dinit_mib .1.3 2>&1 |grep MIBDIR

net-snmp.org/
